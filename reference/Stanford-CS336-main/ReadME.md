> This is the NEW version of my solution, for those who have see my solutions before, here is the [OLD version](https://github.com/YYZhang2025/Stanford-CS336/tree/old-main), if you are interested. 

# Assignment 01: Tokenization & Language Modeling

![](./assets/all_pass_test.png)

## Part 0: Environment Setup & Data Download
We first need install the virtual environment manager `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.

```sh
pip install uv
# or
brew install uv
```

After installing `uv`, we can run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary. 

Or create and activate the environment manually using:
```sh
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

It will install all the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

Than we can download the TinyStories data and a subsample of OpenWebText

``` sh
mkdir -p data
cd data

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-valid.txt

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_train.txt.gz
gunzip owt_train.txt.gz
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_valid.txt.gz
gunzip owt_valid.txt.gz

cd ..
```

It will create a `data` folder in the current directory and download the required datasets into it.

## Part 1: BPE Tokenizer 



With my implementation, it took about 1 min to train the BPE Tokenizer for Tinystories

```bash
Identified 10 chunks for pre-tokenization.
Pre-tokenization processes completed. Aggregating results...
Completed pre-tokenization. Vocabulary size: 59933 unique tokens.
100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 9743/9743 [00:53<00:00, 181.61it/s]
[TIME] train_bpe took 85.40s
```



And token **30mins** to pre-tokenize the whole file and save as `.bin`. 

> [!note]
>
> For those who want to re-produce my results or just want to focus on the model training, I highly recommend to download my version of tokenization, you can download it through following commend:
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U huggingface_hub
> hf download YuYangZhang/TinyStory-Tokenized  --repo-type dataset --local-dir datasets/tiny_stories
> ```
>
> It will download the `merges.txt`, `vocab.json`, `special_tokens.txt`,`train.bin`, `eval.bin` to local-directory. 







## Part 2: Language Model & Optimizer

The Language Model is as following:

![image-20260108071400257](./assets/ass01-lm-overview.png)

Here is the model configuration:

```Python
@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    vocab_size: int = 10000
    max_seq_len: int = 256

    d_model: int = 512
    d_ff: int = 1344

    num_heads: int = 16
    num_layers: int = 4

    dropout: float = 0.1

    use_rms_norm: bool = True
    pre_norm: bool = True

    # Special token IDs
    eos_token_id: int = 256

    # RoPE
    use_rope: bool = True
    rope_theta: float = 10000.0
```







## Part 3: Training Model 



### Configuration 

The train config for my model is following:

```Python
@dataclass
class TrainingConfig:
    batch_size: int = 256
    num_steps: int = 10_000
    dataset_dir: str = "datasets/tiny_stories"
    train_data_path: str = "datasets/tiny_stories/train.bin"
    eval_data_path: str = "datasets/tiny_stories/eval.bin"

    # Optimizer related parameters
    betas: tuple = field(default=(0.9, 0.98))
    weight_decay: float = 1e-5
    max_lr: float = 3e-4
    min_lr: float = 1e-5
    warmup_steps: int = 500
    max_grad_norm: float = 1.0

    # Logging & checkpointing
    wandb_logging: bool = True
    eval_log_interval: int = 500
    sampling_log_interval: int = 200

    # Others:
    model_name: str = "tiny_stories_transformer"
    save_checkpoint_dir: str = "checkpoints"
    device: str = "cpu"
    debug_mode: bool = False
    use_mixed_precision: bool = True
    seed: int = 2025
```



Under this `TrainingConfig` and `ModelConfig`, it took me **34m28s** to finish the training on 1 $\times$ H100 GPU.

### Genrated Sample

```Text
  Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lucy. She was very excited because she had a fancy dress with pink ribbons in it. Her mom gave her a big bag of rice to show her how to use it.
One day, Lucy wanted to help her mom make the best picture. She took a big bag and started to make a pretty picture. It was a modest person who loved peanuts and games. Lucy was very
happy with her picture.
But then, something unexpected happened. The peanuts started to grow and grow into a big, beautiful picture on the wall. Lucy was surprised to see a hat and thought it was her fancy 
pice said. She happy to hug her now was a little between it could the she the the she the day and the the show his the the Max up time the the to the with the ball the the to the the

## Bonus: MoE Layer

In the [Lecture 04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPv1KfUXLCo&list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_&index=4), we have learned about Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer to increase the model capacity without significantly increasing the computation cost. However, in the first assignment, we did not implement the MoE layer in the model. Here is my implementation of the MoE layer using Top-k Gating mechanism, with z-loss and load balancing loss to stabilize the training.


I have implement the MoE layer in  `assignment1-basics/cs336_basics/modules/moe.py` file. And the training code in the `assignment1-basics/train_moe.py` file.  I trained 2 version of the MoE model:

- 4-expert MoE model with same `d_ff` as the dense model `tiny_moe_transformer_batch-256_steps-10000`
- 4-expert MoE model with $\frac{d_{ff}}{4}=336$ as the dense model, name as `
tiny_moe_transformer_small_dff_batch-256_steps-10000`


Below are the learning curves for both MoE models compared with the dense model.

![](./assets/moe-dense-mode.png)

As we can see, the MoE model with smaller `d_ff` outperforms the dense model with same computation cost, demonstrating the effectiveness of MoE layers in increasing model capacity. However, the MoE model with same `d_ff` as dense model does not show significant improvement, possibly due to the increased model size leading to over-fitting on the small TinyStories dataset.




# Assignment 02: Flash Attention & Parallelism
![](./assets/ass02-test.png)


## Flash Attention 

Use we the Triton to implement the Flash Attention, and training on the same model as in Assignment 01. Below are the learning curves. As we can see, due to the same seed and configuration, the Flash Attention implementation matches the standard attention implementation very well.

![](./assets/ass02-train.png)

We compare the training speed of Flash Attention and standard attention below:

![](./assets/attention_bench_backward_bfloat16.png)
![](./assets/attention_bench_forward_bfloat16.png)
![](./assets/attention_bench_fwd+bwd_bfloat16.png)

As we can see, the Flash Attention implementation is significantly faster than the standard attention implementation, especially for longer sequence lengths and forward process. However, for backward process, the speedup is less significant, it might be due to the overhead of custom CUDA kernel launches in Triton. Overall, Flash Attention provides a substantial speedup for attention computation in transformer models.



## Parallelism

We have implemented the data parallelism in the `assignment2-systems/cs336_systems/parallel/ddp_bucket.py` file. And we can run the distributed training using following command:

```bash
cd assignment2-systems
./scripts/train_pp_flashattention.sh
```

to training the model with Flash Attention and Data Parallelism.


>[!note]
> Due to the limitation of my current hardware, I am not able to fully test the data parallelism implementation. When I run the above command, it actually **SLOWER** than single GPU training, which might be due to the overhead of process communication outweighing the benefits of parallelism on my single machine with limited resources. However, I have verified the correctness of the implementation through unit tests and code review. I believe that on a proper multi-GPU setup, the data parallelism implementation will provide significant speedup for training large models.




# Assignment 03: Scaling Laws 
```Python
raise NotImplementedError("This is a placeholder for Assignment 03 solution.")
```


# Assignment 04: Data 
```Python
raise NotImplementedError("This is a placeholder for Assignment 04 solution.")
```

# Assignment 05: Alignment & RLHF (GRPO)



In this assignment, we implement LLM alignment, which refers to post-training methods that steer a pretrained language model toward desired behaviors (e.g., following instructions, producing safe and helpful outputs, or solving tasks more reliably).



For the Reasoing dataset, we are use two main datasets:



- [GSM8k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k): a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems.
- [Math-12k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlile/hendrycks-MATH-benchmark):  a collection of mathematics competition problems



First, let's see the "zero-shot" ability of the Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model performance:



| split | dataset_path      | total | answer_correct | format_correct | reward_1 | formatted_but_answer_wrong | answer_accuracy |
| ----- | ----------------- | ----- | -------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| train | math/train.jsonl  | 12000 | 359            | 2038           | 359      | 1679                       | 0.029           |
| test  | math/test.jsonl   | 500   | 13             | 77             | 13       | 64                         | 0.026           |
| train | gsm8k/train.jsonl | 7473  | 232            | 1433           | 232      | 1201                       | 0.031           |
| test  | gsm8k/test.jsonl  | 1319  | 41             | 258            | 41       | 217                        | 0.031           |



## SFT 

The first algorithm we implement is **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**. The core implementation is in `assignment5-alignment/cs336_alignment/algs/sft.py`. The primary training configuration is:



```Python
total_training_steps: int = 500         # total number of training steps
batch_size: int = 4                     # mini-batch size
gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 64   # gradient accumulation steps

# Optimizer hyperparameters
betas: tuple = (0.9, 0.98)
weight_decay: float = 1e-5
max_lr: float = 5e-6
max_grad_norm: float = 1.0
```



Under this configuration, we obtain the following training curves:



![math-gsm8k-accuracy](./assets/math-gsm8k-accuracy.png)



![sft-format (1)](./assets/sft-format.png)



## Expert Iteration

The second algorithm is **Expert Iteration (EI)**, implemented in `assignment5-alignment/cs336_alignment/algs/ei.py`. The training configuration is:



```Python
ei_steps: int = 5
ei_batch_size: int = 512
reward_fn: str = "r1_zero_reward_fn"
num_responses_per_prompt: int = 4

# SFT hyperparameters
sft_steps_per_ei_step: int = 100
sft_batch_size: int = 128
sft_gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 64

# Optimizer hyperparameters
betas: tuple = field(default=(0.9, 0.98))
weight_decay: float = 1e-5
max_lr: float = 5e-6
max_grad_norm: float = 1.0
```





We have those learing curve:

![ei-math-accuracy](./assets/ei-math-accuracy.png)



## GRPO 

The third algorithm is **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, popularized by **DeepSeek**. The main implementation is located at `assignment5-alignment/cs336_alignment/algs/grpo.py`. The training configuration is:



```Python
 n_grpo_cur_steps: int = 200
rollout_batch_size: int = 256
learning_rate: float = 1e-5
advantage_eps: float = 1e-6
group_size: int = 8

epochs_per_rollout_batch: int = 1
train_batch_size: int = 256
gradient_accumulation_steps: int = 128

reward_fn: Literal["r1_zero_reward_fn"] = "r1_zero_reward_fn"
cliprange: float = 0.2
norm_by_std: bool = True

# Optimizer hyperparameters
loss_type: Literal["no_baseline", "reinforce_with_baseline", "grpo_clip"] = "grpo_clip"
betas: tuple = field(default=(0.9, 0.95))
weight_decay: float = 0.0
max_lr: float = 5e-6
max_grad_norm: float = 1.0
```



We have following learing curve:
